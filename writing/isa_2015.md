# The institutional dynamics of civil society in authoritarian regimes

## Civil society as a political institution

The idea of a civil society has long been salient, with commentators as early as De Tocqueville theorizing on the importance of groups of citizens that actively engage with their governments to advocate for reform, rights, change, and other services. Civil society is traditionally defined as "an agglomeration of private, voluntary organizations that have the capacity to assert the rights of individuals and groups," [@Cook:2007, 143] and is most commonly operationalized as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or organizations that operate outside of both the private and public sectors, ostensibly filling social gaps left by firms and governments [@AhmedPotter:2006, 30; see also @Hansmann:1980]. Civil society need not be explicitly political or rights-focused—any sort of association, including bowling clubs and parent/teacher associations, allows citizens to come in contact with each other, build social capital, and aggregate individual preferences [@Putnam:1994].

Given this wide range of possible civil society organizations, ranging from neighborhood book clubs to international human rights advocacy NGOs, it has been difficult to address civil society in a consistent theoretical way. To address this, I propose that we can gain significant analytic and theoretical insight into the purpose and function of civil society by analyzing the sector through an institutionalist lens. While formal institutional theory has typically been applied to more traditional institutions such as constitutions, electoral systems, legislative committee assignments, or judiciary structures, these theories can be usefully applied to non-traditional political phenomena like civil society. In particular, institutional theory allows us to see how civil society as an institution lowers transaction costs and promotes coordinated collective action against or in support of the state. 

Simply put, institutions are the collection of rules that define the parameters of social activity, or the "humanly devised constraints that shape human interactions" [@North:1990, 3]. These "rules of the game" dictate who can make decisions, which actions are allowed or prohibited, and how obedience is rewarded and disobedience punished [@Ostrom:1990, 51]. Institutions can range from formal structures like constitutions and property ownership regimes to informal social and cultural norms, practices, and traditions. Ultimately, institutions—both formal and informal—gain traction in society because they reduce the transaction costs of social and economic interaction. When players interact, they can trust that their counterparts will behave appropriately because of the rules of the underlying institutional framework.^[This trust can also be described in game theoretic terms as a state of equilibrium, where institutional arrangements structure the payoffs such that players have little incentive to move [@Weingast:1997; @Greif:2004; @Calvert:1995].] 

Treating civil society as an institution yields the greatest theoretical advantage when considering how civil society organizations and NGOs lower transaction costs by solving difficult collective action problems and public goods dilemmas. Civil society has typically been defined in one of two ways.^[Defined as "Civil Society I" and "Civil Society II" by @FoleyEdwards:1996.] The first school of thought, championed by @Putnam:1994, holds that vibrant associational life forges links that cross social boundaries—bowling clubs, parent/teacher associations, neighborhood groups, volunteer organizations, and other nonprofit groups tend to include members from multiple social strata, thereby breaking down vertical social boundaries and increasing social trust. This associational life increases civic engagement, embeds norms of reciprocity into society, and helps improve democratic governance—in other words, civil society ultimately *strengthens and bolsters* the state.^[Antonio Gramsci offers a bleaker view, arguing that civil society actually contributes to "a more subtle and sophisticated form of state power"—one that "serves as an outer perimeter of defense for a hegemonic state" [@Cook:2007, 7, 143].]

In contrast, others have argued that civil society should stand *in opposition to* the state. The deeper social connections formed by participating in associational life can allow members of these organizations to "stand up to city hall" [@Jamal:2007, 4], to pursue their community self-interests, or to help maintain moral order and social norms. In this view, civil society organizations act as watchdogs against the government (or private sector), providing members of society with a focal point for popular mobilization. While discussing the institutional foundation for public morality—norms that shape the preferences and payoffs for players in a society—Platteau argues:

> A civil society helps to back trust whenever there is a sufficient number of citizens who feel vengeful enough to work towards exposing publicly the illegal acts or malpractices of both private and state agents, and towards bringing enough pressure to sanction them even though such actions entail significant costs to themselves (by denouncing economic crimes they produce a public good) [@Platteau:2000, 308].

@Weingast:1997 provides a more general explanation of how civil society's denouncement of government abuses can be seen as an institutional public good. Institutions prevent rulers from infringing on the rights of their citizens by organizing a "coordinated understanding" of the violation of those rights and allowing citizens to more easily coordinate and respond to potential abuses. That is, when citizens face government abuse, they face a coordination dilemma—they must convince other citizens to band with them to seek redress against the government, which is often difficult. Institutions solve this coordination dilemma in two ways: (1) institutions such as constitutions, legal structures, and civil society provide mechanisms that allow citizens to initially seek redress (e.g. an aggrieved citizen has a constitutional right to sue the government; nonprofit organizations are legally allowed to provide community services the government may be unable to deliver, etc.), and (2) those institutions generate a coordinated understanding—or the expectation that something must and shall be done to address government abuses—among a nation's citizens [@Weingast:1997, 262]. Non-aggrieved citizens assist those who are victims of government abuse because (1) there are institutions in place that allow for redress, and (2) the citizens who are not victims expect that the current victims will come to their aid in the future. Because of this ability to rally popular support for collective action, civil society can be seen as a critical watchdog against government and private sector abuses and thereby protect citizens against the state.

## Authoritarian regimes and institutional balancing

It is clear that civil society can be seen both skeptically (that it serves only to build the state) or optimistically (that it serves only to protect against the state). However, it is perhaps more useful to treat civil society as simply an institutional vehicle for coordinating collective action. As an institution, civil society can exert influence on a regime, pressuring and shaming it to follow specific norms. Conversely, it can also be directed, co-opted, or controlled by the state to help ensure a regime's survival.

A growing literature on the nuances of autocracy has begun to show that authoritarianism is not simply a transitional phase before democracy, but an altogether distinct regime type where autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010]. This newer theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that authoritarians are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements. Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism becomes a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and other institutional reforms [@Stacher:2012, 31].

Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty [@Wintrobe:1990]. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can create narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage. Regimes can also create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to create popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. In either case, if "rulers counter [threats to their rule] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.

Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition [@Brumberg:2002]. However, this devolution of control to third parties—many of which can be actively opposed to the regime—creates an interesting competitive dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents [@LevitskyWay:2010]. Political competition under authoritarianism is "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.

Ultimately, civil society institutions play a dynamic role in authoritarian regimes and are not simply window dressing. As with other political institutions, civil society aggregates social preferences and creates a focal point, or coordinated understanding, that allows citizens to engage with the state in a coordinated manner. However, it is important to not overstate civil society's potential to challenge the state, as authoritarian leaders can influence the sector to ensure regime stability. The relationship between the state and civil society is bidirectional—domestic and international NGOs can act as anti-government watchdogs or as enablers of the regime, depending on how strategic the state is in capturing or co-opting or how effective NGOs are at avoiding that influence.


# A theory of authoritarian civil society restrictions

The existing literature on authoritarian institutions convincingly shows that dictators use pseudo-democratic institutions, including legislatures, judiciaries, and civil society, to keep themselves in power. However, unlike legislatures and more formal political institutions, where political power can more easily be checked and restricted, civil society may operate differently. For example, the 2011 uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt were not headed by legislators and judges (who needed to win elections or secure judicial appointments and thus needed to stay in favor with the regime), but by leaders of formal and informal civil society. Even though these countries' regimes were able to muzzle civil society to some degree, civil society was eventually able to create a Weingastian coordinated understanding and act as a watchdog against government abuse, ultimately forcing a change in the regime. This paradox raises an interesting question: When will an authoritarian regime restrict or permit civil society activities, given the need to carefully balance other institutional challenges?

To answer this question, I propose a simple graphical model to explain the relationship between regimes and civil society (see Figure 1). The model consists of two types of players: (1) the regime (R) and (2) domestic and international civil society organizations (NGOs) that work to promote coordinated understanding and watch for and protect against government abuses. The regime (R) provides a legal environment for NGOs to operate in (E), which grows and constricts depending on the regime's policy preferences and exogenous circumstances. NGOs have their own policy preferences that may or may not overlap with E. Those organizations that operate within the bounds set by the government have the ability to act as a watchdog (albeit with some government supervision), while those outside regime preferences are heavily restricted.

![NGOs operating within different legal environments (E) in an authoritarian regime](../output/model.pdf)

In other words, some regimes will limit what civil society is allowed to do and will punish NGOs that operate outside that boundary, while others will allow for more potential NGO input and oversight. In Figure 1, a regime is shown with two possible legal environments, or attitudes towards civil society organizations. E~1~ is large and permissive, allowing NGO~1~ and NGO~2~ to operate and engage with the government, while NGO~3~ is restricted. If the regime constricts the legal environment to E~2~, NGO~2~ will no longer fall within the allowable bounds of advocacy and will need to either curtail its advocacy work or adopt preferences more amenable to those of the regime. 

Constricting or expanding the legal environment results in both positive and negative consequences for the regime. New research has begun to measure this space and predict when governments will be more or less restrictive towards domestic and international NGOs. @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a find that governments tend to impose restrictions on foreign funding to civil society organizations when they feel threatened, and that these restrictions provide the government with more control over external institutional forces. [Other literatures on institutional restrictions for regime safety…]

However, these restrictions can often backfire, covering up latent unrest that could pose a threat to the regime. As such, regimes also expand the legal environment in strategic ways. @Blaydes:2011 argues that institutionalization in Mubarak's Egypt allowed the regime to gather more information about the opposition and dole out patronage to those loyal to the regime [@Heydemann:2007; @Stacher:2012; @Yerkes:2012; @Carapico:2002]. Similarly, @Teets:2014 has found that Chinese bureaucrats, interested in responding to deficiencies in policies and service provision, engage with INGOs to improve governance. She argues that the government has adopted a new model of governance called "consultative authoritarianism," building regulatory structures that give some types of INGOs the freedom to operate and assist with governance while prohibiting others from fomenting dissent: that is, "local officials [seek] to balance the observed benefits of civil society groups in development with the potential danger of social mobilization by encouraging the formation of autonomous groups while developing a system of positive and negative incentives to guide group activities in desired directions" [-@Teets:2014, 60]. 

The regime, therefore, expands the legal environment (E) to mitigate social unrest, control competitors and challengers, and keep itself in power. However, domestic factors likely influence the regime's ability to engage in this careful institutional balancing act. Government instability can lead to retrenchment against potential threats, as regimes restrict legislatures, judiciaries, labor unions, and other institutional actors. As such, I hypothesize that:

> H1a: Autocratic regimes will be *more likely* to restrict associational life when their governments are unstable.

Competitiveness in regime politics likely has a more direct effect on civil society and other institutional restrictions. Autocrats may allow for institutional dissonance as a way to consolidate support, but once they are firmly in power, they may be able to reconstrict those allowances. Regular competition for political power could temper the propensity to turn to outright dictatorship. Thus: 

> H1b: Autocratic regimes will be *more likely* to restrict associational life the longer the executive remains in office.

and

> H2a: Autocratic regimes will be *more likely* to restrict associational life the longer it has been since holding a competitive election.

Relatedly, as competition for power becomes more real and the likelihood of losing increases, an authoritarian regime will permit more institutional dissonance, paradoxically giving the opposition and its supporters more space to operate, but strategically keeping itself in power. Therefore:

> H2b. Autocratic regimes will be *less likely* to restrict associational life when the opposition is stronger and more likely to win.

In other words, I hypothesize that government preferences toward associational life (E) is a function of both regime stability and regime competitiveness. Governments that are less stable and less competitive will fear engaging with civil society as an institutional actor and will be more likely to consolidate and shrink any watchdog space. Conversely, stable and competitive regimes will expand the legal environment for associational life to benefit from the mechanisms of regime stability civil society might provide (i.e. more control over social interactions, knowledge transfer from foreign experts, etc.).


# Data and methods

To determine if internal regime stability and political competitiveness have an effect on civil society restrictions in authoritarian countries, I construct a new time-series cross-sectional dataset of 197 countries from 1981–2011, compiling a set of variables from several existing and well established datasets. 

## Dependent variable

In an effort to capture the broadest definition of advocacy space, I use data from the CIRI Human Rights dataset which provides indices of human rights restrictions based on close readings of annual US State Department *Country Reports on Human Rights Practices* [@CingranelliRichardsClay:2014]. Among the rights measured by CIRI is a measure of the restrictions on the freedom of assembly and association, or how easily citizens can participate in trade unions, cultural organizations, or domestic and international NGOs. Countries can receive three different scores each year: severely restricted, limited, and unrestricted (coded as 0, 1, and 2 in the original CIRI data), based on the severity and universality of civil society restrictions within each country. 

![Worldwide civil society restrictions in an average year](../output/assn_summary.pdf)

This measure is far from perfect. With only three possible outcomes the data is not granular and at times slow moving. Additionally, it does not distinguish between the restrictions on different types of civil society groups, in particular between domestic and international organizations. However, because it captures restrictions on civil society more generally, it works well as a rough proxy for the allowable advocacy space a regime provides for its citizens. Figure 2 shows the distribution of country-level restrictions in an average year. Though most countries tend to not restrict civil society activities, a substantial number do regularly impose restrictions.

I use two different methods to distinguish between democracies and autocracies. First, I use data from the Polity IV project, which assigns democracy scores ranging from −10 to 10 [@MarshallJaggers:2014]. Regime type labels are then assigned based on this score: autocracies (−10 to −6), closed anocracies (−5 to 0), open anocracies (1 to 5), and democracies (6 to 10). However, while these categories of democratization are useful at large magnitudes (i.e. there is a clear difference between a country that scores a −8 on the Polity IV scale and one that scores a 6), marginal changes in democratization scores are often meaningless (i.e. a change from a level 5 anocracy to a level 6 democracy is rather imperceptible and more susceptible to rater subjectivity). The Unified Democracy Score (UDS) scale was created in 2010 to address the uncertainty inherent in measuring democratization [@PemsteinMeserveMelton:2010]. This innovative scale uses Bayesian estimation and simulation to generate aggregate democracy scores based on 10 other standard measurement scales (including Polity IV). Instead of assigning each country a single score, the UDS provides every country-year with a posterior score distribution, including a mean and a median score, a standard deviation, and 95% confidence intervals. UDS scores range from −2 to 2, with more democratic nations receiving higher scores. For this working paper, I only use the mean point estimates in my analysis, but in the future I will use UDS scores in Monte Carlo simulations to capture more uncertainty in regime type classification.

![Distribution of civil society restrictions across different levels of democratization](../output/regime_type_summary.pdf)

Figure 3 shows the distribution of civil society restrictions across different regime types using violin plots, or horizontally mirrored density plots [@HintzeNelson:1998]. Using a broad definition of autocracy (a score of less than 0 in the Polity IV and UDS scales) autocratic regimes are clearly more likely to impose restrictions on civil society activities. However, variation in these restrictions remains to be explained.


## Key independent variables

As explained earlier, I hypothesize that regime stability and competitiveness predict restrictions on civil society. I measure stability in two ways. First, I use data from Political Risk Services' International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) to measure the internal cohesion of a regime [@Political-Risk-Services:2014]. ICRG compiles an annual index of government stability based on expert opinions on government unity, legislative strength, and popular support, with values ranging from 0 to 12. As seen in the left panel of Figure 4, most governments tend to score around 8–9 regardless of the types of restrictions imposed on civil society. Second, I measure how many consecutive years the executive has been in office with data from the World Bank's Database of Political Institutions [@BeckClarkeGroff:2001], which indicates the longevity of the regime. The right panel of Figure 4 shows that while few regimes have had rulers in place for longer than 10 years, those with long-tenured executives tend to have stricter restrictions on civil society. Following my theory, countries that have higher ICRG stability scores and executives with long tenure should be more likely to restrictions on freedom of assembly and association.

![Distribution of civil society restrictions across regime stability](../output/stability_summary.pdf)

I also measure regime competitiveness in two ways. First, using data from the National Elections Across Democracy and Autocracy (NELDA) project [@HydeMarinov:2012], I calculate the number of years that have passed since a country held a competitive election. Following @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a, I consider an election competitive if opposition parties were allowed to participate, if more than one political party was legal, and if the ballot provided voters with a choice of candidates. As seen in the left panel of Figure 5, most countries—even those that impose severe restrictions on civil society activities—tend to not let too many years pass between competitive elections, likely indicative of the emergence and strength of competitive authoritarianism. Even the most restrictive regimes allow for some (limited) competition. Second, I measure the vote share won by the largest opposition party, as measured by the Database of Political Institutions. The right panel of Figure 5 shows that countries with severe associational restrictions tend to have very low opposition victory rates, while countries with fewer restrictions have much more variability in vote shares. In theory, countries that allow more time to lapse between competitive elections and have less successful opposition parties will enact stricter restrictions on assembly and association.

![Distribution of civil society restrictions across regime competitiveness](../output/competitiveness_summary.pdf)


## Control variables

I also control for a variety of domestic and international factors that could also influence a regime's decision to restrict civil society activities. Domestically, I control for a regime's propensity to violate the physical integrity rights of its citizens using data from the CIRI project. Governments that use torture, extrajudicial killing, disappearance, and other violent tactics are likely to restrict associational life. I also control for each country's GDP per capita (in constant 2005 dollars) and population, both measured by the World Bank [@WDI:2015]. I log both variables to account for their exponential distribution.

Internationally, I check to see how embedded regimes are in the international community. Following @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a, I include the amount of development aid to determine the regime's dependency on foreign donors. I also include a count of the number people who are members or volunteers in international NGOs with branch offices in that country, following @Murdie:2013a, using data from the Yearbook of International Organizations. More INGO involvement in a regime could mitigate the government's attempts at restricting associational life. Finally, I include the KOF Index of Globalization [@DreherGastonMartens:2008] to measure the regime's economic, social, and political embeddedness. 


## Modeling decisions

Because the dependent variable consists of three potential outcomes ("severely restricted," "limited," and "unrestricted" freedom of association), I use a series of ordinal logistic regression models to estimate the effects of regime stability and competitiveness on government restrictions of associational life.

To control for variation within and between countries and years, I include random effects terms in two of the models. Researchers typically include fixed effects, or indicator variables, in regression models to produce less-biased coefficient estimates. However, fixed effects models are often subject to high sample-to-sample variability and are overly sensitive to random error in the data, especially if the model's covariates vary little relative to the outcome variable [@ClarkLinzer:2015, 6–7]. Additionally, many of the variables in this data are sluggish (such as restrictions on associational life and regime type) and change slowly during the 30 years of collected observations. As such, including country and year fixed effects leads to unstable and often inestimable models with unreliable coefficients. Random effects can deal better with slow moving data and produce estimates with lower and more accurate variance. Using random effects is not a magic bullet, though—it carries the mathematical assumption that the main covariates of interest (government stability and competitiveness) are not correlated with year or country effects. Violations of this assumption lead to biased estimators. However, given that this particular model is so unstable when using fixed effects, I trade the unbiased fixed effects estimations for the bias of random effects to gain (1) lower variance in estimations and (2) the mathematical ability to actually fit the model.


# Results

Figure 6 presents the estimates from a series of ordinal logistic regression models using Polity IV scores as an independent variable (rather than UDS). A table with detailed coefficients and standard errors for models using mean UDS scores is included in the appendix (for ease of interpretability, I have used Polity IV models as the baseline for my analysis. At this stage, using non-simulated UDS scores and Polity IV scores yield results with only trivial differences in coefficients. In the future, I will replace these results with those from the ostensibly more accurate simulated UDS models). 

![Coefficient plot for all Polity IV models](../output/coef_plot.pdf)

![Separation plots for all Polity IV models](../output/sep_plots.pdf)

A visual representation of each model's fit is shown in the separation plots in Figure 7 [@GreenhillWardSacks:2011]. In these plots, the fitted values—or $\hat{p}$—for each of the response outcomes are sorted from lowest to highest (i.e., the observations with the lowest probability are on the left of the plot), and observations where the response outcome actually occurred are colored in blue. Rearranging the data in this manner provides a quick and accurate visual check of model fit. The values of $\hat{p}$ are plotted as a black line to show the fitted probabilities across each outcome, and triangle markers indicate the expected number of events, calculated by summing the predicted probabilities for each outcome: $\sum^{N}_{i = 1} \hat{p}_i$. When actual events are clustered to the right of the expected number of events (associated with high fitted values) and non-events are clustered to the left (associated with low fitted values), it indicates that the model predicts outcomes well. The separation plots show a progression of marginal improvements in model fit. All three models tend to accurately predict cases of severe restriction, with starker separation in the full model with random effects. Similarly, all models predict unrestricted outcomes fairly well, though the simple model appears to underpredict, since the sum of $\hat{p}$ appears much lower than the other models, resulting in a triangle well to the right of the inflection in the predicted probability curve. Predicting limited restrictions is the most difficult category to forecast, with each plot failing to clearly separate (and appearing more like a barcode). However, the full model with random effects does result in the highest fitted probabilities for the category.

In all three model specifications, both measures of regime competitiveness have a statistically significant effect on the level of civil society restrictions in a regime. For every year since a competitive election, the probability of improving civil society restrictions (i.e. moving from severely restricted to limited) decreases by nearly 6% (β = −0.06, z = −2.46, p = 0.014). Conversely, for every increase in the opposition vote share, the probability of being classified at a less restrictive level of associational life increases by 2.5% (β = 0.024, z = 2.85, p = 0.004), *ceteris paribus*.

Two of the control variables have a large significant impact on associational restrictions. Unsurprisingly, given Figure 3, increased democratization dramatically increases the probability that civil society will be unrestricted. Physical integrity rights also improve a regime's restrictions. As governments torture and abuse their citizens less, they (again, unsurprisingly) are less likely to restrict freedom of assembly and association.

![Predicted probabilities of civil society restrictions across a range of potential opposition vote shares, years since previous competitive election, and regime type, over 500 simulated draws of model coefficients with all other model variables held at their means](../output/comp_pred_probs.pdf)

The marginal changes of 2.5% and 6% for the two measures of competitiveness are minimal, but they appear to have some substantial impact on restrictions when combined. The changes in predicted probabilities are readily apparent in Figure 8, which shows the probability of civil society restrictions across (1) all possible values of opposition strength, (2) three representative periods of time elapsed since the previous competitive election (4, 8, and 12 years), and (3) two representative types of regimes (a −6 and a 6 on the Polity IV scale). All other model variables are held constant at their means. Coefficients were redrawn from a multivariate normal distribution 500 times to demonstrate the uncertainty in the model's predictions. 

Autocratic regimes appear to have a 60–70% chance of imposing moderate restrictions on associational life—by far the norm. In regimes where the opposition has little chance of winning, severe restrictions are the second most likely outcome. However, as the opposition becomes more competitive, the probability of severe restrictions decreases dramatically. The effect of the number of years since a competitive election is also quite marked. As more time elapses, the probability of severe restrictions moves upward across the whole range of opposition vote shares. In the top right panel of Figure 8, severe restrictions and moderate restrictions are equally likely in perpetually uncompetitive regimes where the opposition rarely wins any seats. The impact of democracy on civil society restrictions is quite apparent as well (see the bottom row of Figure 8). The likelihood of limited or unrestricted civil society switches as opposition parties gain more power, and the probability of seeing severely restricted civil society is near zero no matter how long the hypothetical gap between competitive elections.

Given this evidence, hypotheses 2a and 2b appear to be supported by the data—authoritarian regimes are more likely to restrict associational life as more time transpires between competitive elections and less likely to do so when the opposition has more political power. 

![Predicted probabilities of civil society restrictions across a range of potential levels of government stability, years executive has been in office, and regime type, over 500 simulated draws of model coefficients with all other model variables held at their means](../output/stability_pred_probs.pdf)

However, neither of the measures of regime stability—internal government stability and the number of years the executive has been in office—appear to have a substantive or significant effect on the level of restrictions on associational life. Figure 9 demonstrates this visually. In both autocracies and democracies, the probability of each possible outcome is relatively stable across the full range of ICRG government stability score (though the likelihood of severe restrictions does decrease). The tenure of the executive does little to shift those probabilities—the left and right panels in both types of regimes are essentially identical. I do not therefore find evidence for hypotheses 1a and 1b: internal regime stability and executive tenure do not have a clear effect on civil society restrictions in authoritarian regimes.
