Take stuff from comps, ISA proposal, Vanberg proposal 


# Hypotheses

As seen above, the existing literature on authoritarian institutions shows that dictators often use democratic institutions, including legislatures, judiciaries, and civil society, to keep themselves in power. However, unlike legislatures and more formal political institutions, where political power can more easily be checked and restricted, civil society may operate differently. The 2011 uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt were not headed by legislators and judges, but by leaders of formal and informal civil society. Even though these countries' regimes were able to muzzle civil society to some degree, civil society was eventually able to create a Weingastian coordinated understanding and act as a watchdog against government abuse, ultimately forcing a change in the regime. This paradox raises interesting questions: What gives civil society the power to organize coordinated understanding and act as a watchdog, even within authoritarian regimes? What determines when a regime will restrict or permit civil society activities?

To answer these questions, I propose a simple graphical model to explain the relationship between regimes and civil society (see Figure X). The model consists of two types of players: (1) the government (G) and (2) domestic and international civil society organizations (NGOs) that work to promote coordinated understanding and watch for and protect against government abuses. The government provides a legal environment for NGOs to operate in (E), which grows and constricts depending on the regime's policy preferences and exogenous circumstances. NGOs have their own policy preferences that may or may not overlap with E. Those organizations that operate within the bounds set by the government have the ability to act as a watchdog (albeit with some government supervision), while those outside regime preferences are heavily restricted. In other words, some regimes will limit what civil society is allowed to do and will punish NGOs that operate outside that boundary, while others will allow for more potential NGO input and oversight.

It is clear that the latitude a government provides for associational life is a critical factor in determining how much power NGOs can wield as watchdogs. New research has begun to measure this space and predict when governments will be more or less restrictive towards domestic and international NGOs.

and 

> H2b. Autocratic regimes will be *less likely* to restrict associational life when the opposition is stronger and more likely to win.

In other words, I hypothesize that the government preferences toward associational life (E in Figure X) is a function of both regime stability and regime competitiveness. Governments that are more stable and less competitive will have less of a need to engage with civil society as an institutional actor and will be more likely to consolidate and shrink any watchdog space. 


# Data and methods

To determine if internal regime stability and political competitiveness have an effect on civil society restrictions in authoritarian countries, I construct a new time-series cross-sectional dataset of 197 countries from 1981–2011, compiling a set of variables from several existing and well established datasets. 

## Dependent variable

There is unfortunately no perfect measure of advocacy space. Some have measured de jure legal restrictions on foreign funding [@DupuyRonPrakash:2014a], or **X**, or **X**, but each of these measures capture individual dimensions of restrictiveness (i.e. countries that prohibit foreign funding may still allow for domestic-backed advocacy). In an effort to capture the broadest definition of advocacy space, I use data from the CIRI Human Rights dataset which provides indices of human rights restrictions based on close readings of annual US State Department *Country Reports on Human Rights Practices*  [@Citeme]. Among the rights measured by CIRI is a measure of the restrictions on the freedom of assembly and association, or how easily citizens can participate in trade unions, cultural organizations, or domestic and international NGOs. Countries can receive three different score each year: severely restricted, restricted, and unrestricted (coded as 0, 1, and 2 in the original CIRI data), based on the severity and universality of civil society restrictions within each country. 

![Worldwide civil society restrictions in an average year](../output/assn_summary.pdf)

This measure is far from perfect. With only three possible outcomes the data is not granular and at times slow moving. Additionally, it does not distinguish between the restrictions on different types of civil society groups, in particular between domestic and international organizations. However, because it captures restrictions on civil society more generally, it works well as a rough proxy for the allowable advocacy space a regime provides for its citizens. Figure X shows the distribution of country-level restrictions in an average year. Though countries tend to not restrict civil society activities, a substantial number of countries do regularly impose restrictions.

I use two different methods to distinguish between democracies and autocracies. First, I use data from the Polity IV project, which assigns democracy scores ranging from −10 to 10 [@citme]. Regime type labels are then assigned based on this score: autocracies (−10 to −6), closed anocracies (−5 to 0), open anocracies (1 to 5), and democracies (6 to 10). However, while these categories of democratization are useful at large magnitudes (i.e. there is a clear difference between a country that scores a −8 on the Polity IV scale and one that scores a 6), marginal changes in democratization scores are often meaningless (i.e. a change from a level 5 anocracy to a level 6 democracy is rather imperceptible and more susceptible to rater subjectivity). The Unified Democracy Score (UDS) scale was created in 2010 to address the uncertainty inherent in measuring democratization [@PemsteinMeserveMelton:2010]. This innovative scale uses Bayesian estimation and simulation to generate aggregate democracy scores based on 10 other standard measurement scales (including Polity IV). Instead of assigning each country a single score, the UDS provides every country-year with a posterior score distribution, including a mean and a median score, a standard deviation, and 95% confidence intervals. UDS scores range from −2 to 2, with more democratic nations receiving higher scores. For this working paper, I only use the mean point estimates in my analysis, but in the future I will use UDS scores in Monte Carlo simulations to capture more uncertainty in regime type classification.

![Distribution of civil society restrictions across different levels of democratization](../output/regime_type_summary.pdf)

Figure X shows the distribution of civil society restrictions across different regime types using violin plots, or horizontally mirrored density plots [@HintzeNelson:1998]. Using a broad definition of autocracy (a score of less than 0 in the Polity IV and UDS scales) autocratic regimes are clearly more likely to impose restrictions on civil society activities. However, variation in these restrictions remains to be explained.


## Key independent variables

As explained earlier, I hypothesize that regime stability and competitiveness predict restrictions on civil society. I measure stability in two ways. First, I use data from Political Risk Services' International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) to measure to determine the internal cohesion of a regime [@citeme]. ICRG compiles an annual index of government stability based on expert opinions on government unity, legislative strength, and popular support, with values ranging from 0 to 12. As seen in the left panel of Figure X, most governments tend to score around 8–9 regardless of the types of restrictions imposed on civil society. Second, I measure how many consecutive years the executive has been in office with data from the World Bank's Database of Political Institutions [@citeme], which indicates the longevity of the regime. The right panel of Figure X shows that while few regimes have had rulers in place for longer than 10 years, those with long-tenured executives tend to have stricter restrictions on civil society. Following my theory, countries that have higher ICRG stability scores and executives with long tenure should be more likely to restrictions on freedom of assembly and association.

![Distribution of civil society restrictions across different levels of regime stability](../output/stability_summary.pdf)

I also measure regime competitiveness in two ways. First, using data from the National Elections Across Democracy and Autocracy (NELDA) project [@citeme], I calculate the number of years that have passed since a country held a competitive election. Following @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a, I consider an election competitive if opposition parties were allowed to participate, if more than one political party was legal, and if the ballot provided voters with a choice of candidates. As seen in the left panel of Figure X, most countries—even those that impose sever restrictions on civil society activities—tend to not let too many years pass between competitive elections, likely indicative of the emergence and strength of competitive authoritarianism. Even the most restrictive regimes allow for some (limited) competition. Second, I measure the vote share won by the largest opposition party, as measured by the Database of Political Institutions. The right panel of Figure X shows that countries with severe associational restrictions tend to have very low opposition victory rates, while countries with fewer restrictions have much more variability in vote shares. In theory, countries that allow more time to lapse between competitive elections and have less successful opposition parties will enact stricter restrictions on assembly and association.

## Control variables

I also control for a variety of domestic and international factors that could also influence a regime's decision to restrict civil society activities. Domestically, I control for a regime's propensity to violate the physical integrity rights of its citizens using data from the CIRI project. Governments that use torture, extrajudicial killing, disappearance, and other violent tactics are likely to restrict associational life. I also control for each country's GDP per capita (in constant 2005 dollars) and population, both measured by the World Bank [@citeme]. I log both variables to account for their exponential distribution.

Internationally, I check to see how embedded regimes are in the international community. Following @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a, I include the amount of development aid to determine the regime's dependency on foreign donors. I also include a count of the number people who are members or volunteers in international NGOs with branch offices in that country, following @Murdie:2013a, using data from the Yearbook of International Organizations. More INGO involvement in a regime could mitigate the government's attempts at restricting associational life. Finally, I include the KOF Index of Globalization [@citeme] to measure the regime's economic, social, and political embeddedness. 

To control for variation within and between countries I include random effects. **Random effects explanation here**.


# Results

Figure X presents the estimates from a series of ordinal logistic regression models using Polity IV scores as an independent variable (rather than UDS). A table with detailed coefficients and standard errors for models using mean UDS scores is included in the appendix (for ease of interpretability, I have used Polity IV models as the baseline for my analysis. At this stage, using non-simulated UDS scores and Polity IV scores yield results with only trivial differences in coefficients. In the future, I will replace these results with those from the ostensibly more accurate simulated UDS models). 

![Coefficient plot for all Polity IV models](../output/coef_plot.pdf)

![Separation plots for all Polity IV models](../output/sep_plots.pdf)

A visual representation of each model's fit is shown in the separation plots in Figure X [@GreenhillWardSacks:2011]. In these plots, the fitted values—or $\hat{p}$—for each of the response outcomes are sorted from lowest to highest (i.e., the observations with the lowest probability are on the left of the plot), and observations where the response outcome actually occurred are colored in blue. Rearranging the data in this manner provides a quick and accurate visual check of model fit. The values of $\hat{p}$ are plotted as a black line to show the fitted probabilities across each outcome, and triangle markers indicate the expected number of events, calculated by summing the predicted probabilities for each outcome: $\sum^{N}_{i = 1} \hat{p}_i$. When actual events are clustered to the right of the expected number of events (associated with high fitted values) and non-events are clustered to the left (associated with low fitted values), it indicates that the model predicts outcomes well. The separation plots show a progression of marginal improvements in model fit. All three models tend to accurately predict cases of severe restriction, with starker separation in the full model with random effects. Similarly, all models predict unrestricted outcomes fairly well, though the simple model appears to underpredict, since the sum of $\hat{p}$ appears much lower than the other models, resulting in a triangle well to the right of the inflection in the predicted probability curve. Predicting limited restrictions is the most difficult category to forecast, with each plot failing to clearly separate (and appearing more like a barcode). However, the full model with random effects does result in the highest fitted probabilities for the category.

In all three model specifications, both measures of regime competitiveness have a statistically significant effect on the level of civil society restrictions in a regime. For every year since a competitive election, the probability of improving civil society restrictions (i.e. moving from severely restricted to restricted) decreases by nearly 6% (β = −0.06, z = −2.46, p = 0.014). Conversely, for every increase in the opposition vote share, the probability of being classified at a less restrictive level of associational life increases by 2.5% (β = 0.024, z = 2.85, p = 0.004), ceteris paribus.

#### TODO: Discuss control variables, especially polity and CIRI

![Predicted probabilities of civil society restrictions across a range of potential opposition vote shares, years since previous competitive election, and regime type, over 500 simulated draws of model coefficients with all other model variables held at their means](../output/comp_pred_probs.pdf)

Competitiveness is statistically significant, but does it lead to a substantive effect on restrictions? Marginal changes of 2.5% and 6% are minimal, but they appear to have some actual impact when compounded. The changes in predicted probabilities are ready apparent in Figure X, which shows the probability of civil society restrictions across (1) all possible values of opposition strength, (2) three representative periods of time elapsed since the previous competitive election (4, 8, and 12 years), and (3) two representative types of regimes (a −6 and a 6 on the Polity IV scale). All other model variables are held constant at their means. Coefficients were redrawn from a multivariate normal distribution 500 times to demonstrate the uncertainty in the model's predictions. 

Autocratic regimes appear to have a 60–70% chance of imposing moderate restrictions on associational life—by far the norm. In regimes where the opposition has little chance of winning, severe restrictions are the second most likely outcome. However, as the opposition becomes more competitive, the probability of severe restrictions decreases dramatically. The effect of the number of years since a competitive election is also quite marked. As more time elapses, the probability of severe restrictions moves upward across the whole range of opposition vote shares. In the top right panel of Figure X, severe restrictions and moderate restrictions are equally likely in perpetually uncompetitive regimes where the opposition rarely wins any seats. The impact of democracy on civil society restrictions is quite apparent as well (see the bottom row of Figure X). The likelihood of limited or unrestricted civil society switches as opposition parties gain more power, and the probability of seeing severely restricted civil society is near zero no matter how long of a hypothetical gap between competitive elections.

Given this evidence, hypotheses 2a and 2b are supported by the data—authoritarian regimes are more likely to restrict associational as more time transpires between competitive elections and less likely to do so when the opposition has more political power. 

![Predicted probabilities of civil society restrictions across a range of potential levels of government stability, years executive has been in office, and regime type, over 500 simulated draws of model coefficients with all other model variables held at their means](../output/stability_pred_probs.pdf)

However, neither of the measures of regime stability—internal government stability and the number of years the executive has been in office—appear to have a substantive or significant effect on the level of restrictions on associational life. Figure X demonstrates this visually. In both autocracies and democracies, the probability of each possible outcome is relatively stable across the full range of ICRG government stability score (though the likelihood of severe restrictions does decrease). The tenure of the executive does little to shift those probabilities—the left and right panels in both types of regimes are essentially identical. I do not therefore find evidence for hypotheses 1a and 1b: internal regime stability and executive tenure do not have a clear effect on civil society restrictions in authoritarian regimes.
