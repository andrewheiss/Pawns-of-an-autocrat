# Domestic and International Civil Society in Dictatorships: Forerunners of Democratization or Pawns of an Autocrat?

Recent scholarship has found that autocrats use a variety of mechanisms to maintain stability and mitigate social conflict. In addition to political parties, elite co-optation, elections, and violence, autocrats often use legal restrictions and offers of patronage to co-opt local NGOs to lend the regime enhanced credibility and neutralize potential threats they may pose. However, autocrats have fewer options to restrict *international* NGOs. Why do autocrats allow INGOs to operate in their countries when these groups pose a potential threat to their regime's stability and international standing? What options do autocrats have to restrict their activities?

This project combines (1) analysis of a medium-n dataset of human rights and advocacy INGOs operating in non-Western countries and (2) a case study of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (a Cairo-based NGO), and the Arab Human Rights Fund (a Netherlands-based INGO ). The findings should indicate that the variation in INGO restrictions can be partially explained by a regime's need to use them as a mechanism for regime stabilityâ€”more consolidated dictatorships should see reduced INGO activity. Because the results explain when a regime might use INGOs as political pawns, these findings will have important implications for INGOs working in authoritarian nations.
