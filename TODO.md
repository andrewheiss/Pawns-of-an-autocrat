TODO: 

* theme_ath() too miminalist - add axes, gridlines
* Figure out correct time frame, limit data to that
* Visualize all variables
* Make a running variable for stability (years since last competititive election?)
* Build models and visualize them
* Figure out panel corrections for standard errors, clustering, serial autocorrelation, etc.
* Simulate UDS cutoffs, run models for simulated data, plot accordingly
* Lag?
* Year fixed effects
* Check how likely it is to have stable vs. unstable autocracy vs. democracy (so I'm not just testing outliers)
* Show variation in stability across UDS (to see if there's collinearity, too much correlation)
* Simulate UDS scores + determine threshold for autocracy?
* See if switch is only the case in autocracies - run two models/predictions, one for high UDS, one for low UDS - it'd be really cool if switch only happens with low UDS
