TODO: 

* Visualize all variables
* Figure out panel corrections for standard errors, clustering, serial autocorrelation, etc.
* Simulate UDS cutoffs, run models for simulated data, plot accordingly
* Lag?
* Check how likely it is to have stable vs. unstable autocracy vs. democracy (so I'm not just testing outliers)
* Show variation in stability across UDS (to see if there's collinearity, too much correlation)
* Simulate UDS scores + determine threshold for autocracy?
* See if switch is only the case in autocracies - run two models/predictions, one for high UDS, one for low UDS - it'd be really cool if switch only happens with low UDS
